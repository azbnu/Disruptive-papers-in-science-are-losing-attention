Disruptive Papers in Science Are Losing Attention

Overview
This repository contains key custom codes used in the data-driven research for the paper titled "Disruptive papers in science are losing attention." Our study leverages extensive publication data from the American Physical Society (APS) and SciSciNet, covering a broad range of disciplines. The goal of our research is to analyze the evolving dynamics of attention towards disruptive scientific papers over time.

Data Sources
Our analyses are based on two publicly available large-scale datasets:
American Physical Society (APS): A comprehensive dataset containing publication records from the field of Physics.
SciSciNet: A vast database of scientific publications across all disciplines.
Both datasets can be freely downloaded online and are instrumental in our study for extracting the necessary data to conduct the analyses presented in our paper.

Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
README.md: Provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to navigate the codes and datasets.
analysis/: Contains the key custom codes used for the main analyses in our study.
Each code file includes comments specifying the data required for running the analysis. This ensures that users can easily understand the data dependencies and extract the necessary information from the APS and SciSciNet datasets.

Custom Codes
The custom codes provided in this repository are designed to perform the main analyses presented in our paper. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
Correlation analyses between the disruptive nature of papers and the attention they receive.
Temporal trends in the publication of disruptive papers across various disciplines.
Comparative studies between early and late periods of publication to assess the changing dynamics of scientific attention.
Users are encouraged to explore these codes and adapt them to their specific research needs. Additional analyses can be easily conducted by writing new codes based on the methodology and data manipulation techniques demonstrated in the provided scripts.

Getting Started
To get started with the analyses:
Download the APS and SciSciNet datasets from their respective online sources.
Ensure you have a suitable scientific computing environment set up, preferably with MATLAB or Python, as most of the provided codes are written in these languages.
Navigate to the analysis/ directory and explore the custom codes. Each file includes detailed comments on the required data and how to perform the analysis.
